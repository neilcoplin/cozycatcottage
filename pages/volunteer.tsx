              <h1>Volunteer opportunities</h1>
              <p>We welcome volunteers age 13 and older to put their individual talents, skills, and ideas to work. Below are some of the ways our wonderful volunteers assist at the shelter.</p>

                  <h2>Adoption center care takers</h2>
                  <p>Every single day these volunteers ensure our kitties thrive in a healthy and clean environment while they await their forever homes. These volunteers distribute food and water, scoop litter boxes, and assist with dishes and laundry. We have two shifts: mornings (Monday - Sunday, 8:30am - noon) and evenings (Monday - Friday, 5:30pm - 7:30pm).</p>

                  <h2>Adoption counselors</h2>
                  <p>These volunteers assist with the adoption process of our kitties both at Cozy Cat Cottage and partner retailers like Pet Supplies Plus, PetSmart and Petco. All adoption counselors must complete our adoption counselor training in addition to general volunteer training.</p>

                  <h2>Fundraiser and event champions</h2>
                  <p>These individuals help organize, promote, and execute fundraising events for Cozy Cat Cottage. They help set up booths at events like craft shows, assist with mailings, hang up flyers and more.</p>

                  <h2>Maintenance</h2>
                  <p>These volunteers donate their time and talents to help us resolve maintenance issues (appliances, etc.) as they arise at our facility. We often post on our Facebook page when these opportunities occur.</p>

                  <h2>Runners</h2>
                  <p>Opportunities arise throughout the year where we need help picking up bulk donations of food or supplies. These volunteers help us retrieve the donations and deliver them to the shelter.</p>

                  <h2>Recycling</h2>
                  <p>We receive donations of aluminum cans throughout the year. Our recycling volunteers help us deliver the cans to a local recycling center where we receive dollars for the cans.</p>
